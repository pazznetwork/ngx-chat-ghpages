You will not see anything until you log in. Log in via ngx-chat wherever you want (e.g. in a component or a\nservice)\nby injecting ChatService and calling login:\nconstructor(@Inject(CHAT_SERVICE_TOKEN) chatService: ChatService) {\n    chatService.logIn({\n        domain: 'ngx-chat.example',\n        service: 'wss://ngx-chat.example:5280/websocket',\n        password: 'password',\n        username: 'someuser',\n    });\n}Add the following to polyfills.ts:\n/***************************************************************************************************\n * APPLICATION IMPORTS\n */\n(window as any).global = window;Optional: body padding when roster list is expanded\nAdd css styling like the following to your main styles.css if you want to resize your main content when the roster is expanded.\nbody {\n    transition-property: padding-right;\n    transition-duration: 0.4s;\n    padding-right: 0;\n}\n\nbody.has-roster {\n    padding-right: 14em;\n}Get Help\nDocumentation\nBelow you will find some instructions to getting\nstarted.

Chrome uses the operating system trust store for certificates while\nFirefox has a custom implementation.\nthe common name (CN) matches the uri of the service you are connecting to\n\nQ: Can ngx-chat be used without the UI?A: Yes. Inject the chat service via @Inject(CHAT_SERVICE_TOKEN) public chatService: ChatService, login via logIn and start sending\nmessages via the sendMessage method.\nQ: My question is not answeredA: No problem, feel free to raise an issue.\nGet Involved\nDevelopment\nWARNING\nPay attention to your imports in the testing app:\n'@pazznetwork/ngx-chat' instead\nof '../../../projects/pazznetwork/ngx-chat/src/lib/services/adapters/xmpp/plugins/multi-user-chat.plugin'\nPull requests are welcome!\nThe source code for ngx-chat can be found in the projects/pazznetwork/ngx-chat folder.
