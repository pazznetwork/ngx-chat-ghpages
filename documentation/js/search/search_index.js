Chrome uses the operating system trust store for certificates while Firefox has a custom implementation.\nthe common name (CN) matches the uri of the service you are connecting to\n\nQ: Can ngx-chat be used without the UI?A: Yes. Inject the chat service via @Inject(CHAT_SERVICE_TOKEN) public chatService: ChatService, login via logIn and start sending messages via the sendMessage method.\nQ: My question is not answeredA: No problem, feel free to raise an issue.\nGet Involved\nDevelopment\nWARNING\nPay attention to your imports in the testing app:\n'@pazznetwork/ngx-chat' instead of '../../../projects/pazznetwork/ngx-chat/src/lib/services/adapters/xmpp/plugins/multi-user-chat.plugin'\nPull requests are welcome!\nThe source code for ngx-chat can be found in the projects/pazznetwork/ngx-chat folder.\nThe demo application is in the src folder in the project root.\n# clone this repository\ngit clone git@github.com:pazznetwork/ngx-chat.git\ncd ngx-chat\n\n# install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# build the library continuously\nng build @pazznetwork/ngx-chat --watch\n\n# (in another terminal) build the sample app continuously\n# will run the demo application on\n# http://localhost:4200\nng serveBuild the plugin\nnpm run build-lib\nTest the integration of your project with the plugin\n$fileOutDirPath is your npm run build out-dir path\nnpm install $fileOutDirPath\nRun the plugin tests\nnpm run test:once\nCommitting\nFor clean and standardised commit messages we use commit lint, for the format see: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/.\nReleasing\n# increment version number in projects/pazznetwork/ngx-chat/package.json\nVERSION=0.12.0 # change accordingly\nnpm run changelog\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"docs: release $VERSION\"\ngit tag v$VERSION\ngit push origin master --tags\n./push-release.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nCopyright 2020 Pazz GmbH\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
